description: "The House with the Green Shutters is a novel by the Scottish writer\
  \ George Douglas Brown, first published in 1901 by John MacQueen. Set in mid-19th\
  \ century Ayrshire, in the fictitious town of Barbie which is based on his native\
  \ Ochiltree, it consciously violates the conventions of the sentimental kailyard\
  \ school, and is sometimes quoted as an influence on the Scottish Renaissance.\n\
  The novel describes the struggles of a proud and taciturn carrier, John Gourlay,\
  \ against the spiteful comments and petty machinations of the envious and idle villagers\
  \ of Barbie (the \"bodies\"). The sudden return after fifteen years' absence of\
  \ the ambitious merchant, James Wilson, son of a mole-catcher, leads to commercial\
  \ competition against which Gourlay has trouble responding.\nAfter the arrival of\
  \ the railway, Gourlay's position worsens and he begins to invest his hopes and\
  \ money in his neurotic son, John, who cannot live up to his expectations. His scatterbrained\
  \ wife and daughter live in terror of his ferocious temper and take refuge in novelettes\
  \ and daydreaming.\nThe symbol of the family's prosperity is their expensive house\
  \ in the middle of the town:\n\nBoth in appearance and position the house was a\
  \ worthy counterpart of its owner. It was a substantial two-storey dwelling, planted\
  \ firm and gawcey on a little natural terrace that projected a considerable distance\
  \ into the Square. At the foot of the steep little bank shelving to the terrace\
  \ ran a stone wall, of no great height, and the iron railings it uplifted were no\
  \ higher than the sward within. Thus the whole house was bare to the view from the\
  \ ground up, nothing in front to screen its admirable qualities. From each corner,\
  \ behind, flanking walls went out to the right and left, and hid the yard and the\
  \ granaries. In front of these walls the dwelling seemed to thrust itself out for\
  \ notice.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
